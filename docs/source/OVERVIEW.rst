Brainsprite
===========

.. warning:: Brainsprite is at an alpha stage of development. The API may still change radically and new release may not be backward compatible.

Brainsprite is a lightweight javascript library to create interactive brain viewers for web documents. The brain viewer below is generated using brainsprite - you can click on it to change coordinates. Brainsprite also features a high-level python API, making it possible to add a brain viewer to your web document in a single line of code.
